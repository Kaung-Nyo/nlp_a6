    "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs.\n",
